# Anilist.js
### A Full packed library for the anilist api
This is a library for the anilist api maintained by seyja and Instellate.
It will include all the endpoints and has extra features as for example a inbuilt ratelimit preventer that is toggable.

It is easy to setup and use

```javascript
const Anilist = require('@instellate/anilist.js')

const anilist = new Anilist

anilist.search('Jojo\'s bizarre adventure')
```

## In heavy development still!
